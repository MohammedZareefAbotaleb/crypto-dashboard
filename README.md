 Responsive design with TailwindCSS

 Modular Angular architecture with reusable components
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Architecture :-

The project is structured for scalability and clarity:

DashboardComponent  :  Acts as the container for the table and search components & Handles polling logic (start/stop) Passes data to the table

CryptoTableComponent : Displays data in a responsive table Dynamically renders headers Shows sparkline charts inside table cells

SearchComponent : Provides an input for searching cryptos by name (real-time search as you type) Emits events back to DashboardComponent Includes a Clear button

PriceChartComponent : A lightweight wrapper around Chart.js Renders sparklines (line charts with no axes/legend) Fully reusable in different contexts

TopcryptoService : Handles all API requests 

Two main methods: getTop10Coins() → Fetches top 10 by market cap & searchCoins(query) → Fetches coins by name (partial matches) & Includes headers with API key

429interceptor & massage service : handles error 429 for too many request and emits a massage to the dashboard.

📝 Notes on Decisions

Custom Chart Wrapper: Instead of ng2-charts, we use a custom wrapper around Chart.js for more control and less dependency risk.

Polling: Implemented with RxJS interval + switchMap to keep data in sync without page reload.

Search: Emits user queries to DashboardComponent so the same polling mechanism works for both top 10 and searched data.

Styling: TailwindCSS chosen for quick, responsive design and utility-first classes.

Dynamic Table Headers: Driven by a headers array, making the table easy to extend.
